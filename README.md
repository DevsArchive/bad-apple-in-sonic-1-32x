# Bad Apple in Sonic 1 (32X)
Exactly as described. Bad Apple overlayed on top of Sonic 1 via the 32X.

## Note
This makes use of the Sega/"Super Street Fighter 2" mapper, which is not supported by ANY emulator (the hardware manual does specify that it is usable with the 32X). I did test this with a version of Ares that I made had basic support for the mapper. I did submit a PR for preliminary support, so hopefully that'll go through.

I would not be surprised if this doesn't work on hardware. It's untested and I'm a noob. Pointers to issues found would be appreciated, though!
